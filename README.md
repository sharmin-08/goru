# Trapezoidal Rule For Numerical Integration
## 1. Overview
In this project, we used the **Trapezoidal Rule** to approximate the integral of  
`f(x) = e^(-x^2)` from 0 to 1.  
It also compares the result with a high-precision value using the built-in `erf()` function from `<cmath>`.

## 2. Objectives
- Apply numerical integration using the trapezoidal rule.  
- Verify the result against a high-precision library value.  
- Analyze how the number of subintervals (`n`) affects accuracy.
